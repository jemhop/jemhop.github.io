      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been a blogging fan I grew up in an era when blogging was like, so totally uncool, something only oldies and total lame-o&amp;rsquo;s did. There was definitely some truth in that in the early 2010s, but as a Gen Z baby, I missed out on web 1.0 by years and the vast majority of web 2.0.
The only web I&amp;rsquo;ve ever known is a world of frameworks, Bootstrap, and mandatory responsiveness.</description>
