      <description>The problem One of the most recited rules of software developement is that a rewrite is nearly never a good idea. But what if your project is 30 years old and was originally intended as a system to share static documents, now being used for games, photo editing software, and even virtual machines?
The mantra of avoiding rewrites fundamentally applies because of the old adage &amp;ldquo;If it ain&amp;rsquo;t broke, don&amp;rsquo;t fix it&amp;rdquo;, but I would argue that the modern web is extremely broke.</description>
